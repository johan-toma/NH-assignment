  "discharge_note": "**Discharge Notes for Sparky**\n\n**Date:** March 19, 2025\n\nDear [Pet Owner's Name],\n\nWe are happy to inform you that Sparky's procedure today went smoothly. Here\u2019s a summary of what was done and some important information for his care at home:\n\n**Procedure Performed:**\n- Sparky underwent a successful eyelid mass removal today. The mass was carefully excised, and he was closely monitored throughout the procedure to ensure his safety and comfort.\n\n**Post-Procedure Care:**\n1. **Rest and Recovery:** Sparky may be a little groggy or tired today due to the anesthesia. It\u2019s important to let him rest in a quiet, comfortable space at home. Avoid any vigorous activities for the next few days to allow proper healing.\n   \n2. **Medication:** If medications have been prescribed (such as pain relief or antibiotics), please follow the instructions provided on the label. If you have any questions or concerns about administering them, don't hesitate to reach out.\n\n3. **Incision Care:** Keep an eye on the incision site around Sparky's eye. It should remain clean and dry. If you notice any swelling, redness, or discharge, please contact us as these could be signs of infection.\n\n4. **E-Collar:** To prevent Sparky from scratching or rubbing the surgical site, he may need to wear an Elizabethan collar (E-collar) until the incision is healed.\n\n5. **Follow-up Appointment:** We recommend scheduling a follow-up appointment in about 10-14 days to assess Sparky\u2019s recovery and remove any sutures if necessary.\n\n6. **Diet and Hydration:** Ensure Sparky has access to fresh water at all times and resumes his normal diet unless otherwise advised.\n\nWe\u2019re here to support you and Sparky during his recovery. If you notice any unusual behavior, have questions about his healing process, or need further assistance, please don\u2019t hesitate to call us at [Veterinary Clinic Phone Number].\n\nThank you for entrusting us with Sparky\u2019s care.\n\nWarm regards,\n\n[Your Name]  \nVeterinary Assistant  \n[Veterinary Clinic Name]"
